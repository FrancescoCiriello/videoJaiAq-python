# videoJaiAq-python
A repository of files to acquire videos using our JAI 5000-M USB cameras in the CUED Fluids laboratory.

Steps for use:
1. Install Python/Anaconda

2. Install relevant python modules:
- !pip install harvesters
- !pip install numpy
- !pip install opencv

3. Install JAI SDK
- identify path to the relevant .cti file, e.g. 'C:/Program Files/JAI/SDK/bin/JaiUSB3vTL.cti')

4. run .py script

You've now acquired your first video from the JAI cameras using python.

N.B. You can use this for any GenICam camera - kudos to @kazunarikudo for developing harvester
